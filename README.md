Power BI Analysis of LEED-certified building sustainability performance

📌 Project Overview

This project evaluates how LEED-certified buildings perform in key sustainability categories, focusing on Energy & Atmosphere (EA) and Materials & Resources (MR).
A dataset of four LEED v4 buildings (three in Germany, one in the U.S.) is analyzed using Excel and Power BI to identify trends, gaps, and regional differences.

📊 Dashboard Overview

This Power BI dashboard visualizes LEED v4 scoring across regions, categories, and certification levels.  
Power BI dashboard includes:
KPI cards (LEED %, CO₂ reduction, Energy Gap)
Regional comparison (Germany vs U.S.)
Scatter plot (EA vs Certification Level)
Circularity bar chart
Detailed scorecard table

📌 Objectives

Analyze EA and MR credit performance across multiple LEED projects
Identify strong credits (e.g., Optimize Energy Performance) and underused ones (e.g., Advanced Metering, Lifecycle Analysis)
Compare regional differences (Germany vs U.S.)
Visualize results through interactive Power BI dashboards
Provide insights for bridging the design–performance gap

📊 Data & Tools

Data Source:
Public LEED v4 scorecards from USGBC (Core & Shell and New Construction)
Tools Used:
Microsoft Excel (data cleaning)
Power BI (visualization)
LEED v4 credit structure
Benchmarking with DIN V 18599 & ISO 50001


🔍 Key Findings

Optimize Energy Performance scores highest across all buildings (avg. 15.5/18).

Advanced Energy Metering = 0 points in all projects → major performance gap.

Germany performs better in MR and Water Efficiency.

U.S. project shows strong EA due to incentive-driven design.

Lifecycle & material transparency credits are underused.

EA scores correlate strongly with certification level.
