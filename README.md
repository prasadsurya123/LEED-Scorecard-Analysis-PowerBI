Power BI Analysis of LEED-certified building sustainability performance

📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes LEED v4 certification scorecards from four buildings located in Germany and the United States.
Using Power BI, the dataset was cleaned, modeled, and visualized to evaluate sustainability performance across major LEED categories with a focus on:
Energy & Atmosphere (EA)
Materials & Resources (MR)
Water Efficiency (WE)
Location & Transportation (LT)
The dashboard enables comparison of certification outcomes, category-level performance, and regional differences in sustainability strategies.

📊 Dashboard Overview
This Power BI dashboard visualizes LEED v4 scoring across regions, categories, and certification levels.  
It highlights energy performance, material transparency, CO₂ reduction potential, and areas with improvement opportunities.

📊 Key Highlights
Highest scoring credit: Optimize Energy Performance (avg ~15.5/18)
Advanced Metering not achieved by any project → notable operational performance gap
German projects showed stronger performance in MR and Waste Management credits
Measurable positive correlation between EA scoring and certification level

🧰 Tech Stack & Skills
